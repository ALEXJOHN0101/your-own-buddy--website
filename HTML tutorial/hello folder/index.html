 <p><p style="background-color: rgb(90, 242, 48);">In this big world ,everyone finds thier way to how to actually link thierself with this world which seems like never ending.
    How ever there are many ways by which you can connect your self with the world and make different types of friends through which 
    you can explore your self and can grow towards what you actually want in life, I myself wonder how people can become so social without even hestitating talking with others in a very good and pleased behaviour </p>
